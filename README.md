# Python_Machine_Learning_Case_Studies_Miscellaneous

Description of the repository

The Python codes and inferences for three case studies are the contents of this repository. These case studies were extra assignments apart from the course work done for the Python Data Science course with Udemy.

The first case study was concerned with the carrying out the Exploratory Data Analysis phase using the Pandas library in Python on a Movies data base, sourced from the University of Minnesota.

The second case sudy was a multi-class classification problem. It involved the building of a classifier (using the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm), for the purpose of classifying into 10 different categories, the actual text messages sent by customers concerning an app that rewards a customer (in the form gift vouchers) for checking into stores (such as fast food restaurants, online retailers, etc.) . The messages could be in the form of greetings, customer compliments, customer critiques, complaints, etc. The Natural Language Tool Kit and the Bag of Words approach was used in the Exploratory Data Analysis phase. This was an end to end analytics project, consisting of the Exploratory Data Analysis phase, the Model Building phase and the Model Validation phase. 

The task of the third case study was to provide a set of python codes to identify the gender of a person, given the first name of that person. The Gender corpus of the Natural Language Tool Kit was used in this regard.
